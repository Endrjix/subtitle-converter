00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,832
[Brooks]
Dotsub's number one mission is to ensure

2
00:00:02,832 --> 00:00:05,960
that video can be communicated
to as many people as possible in the world.

00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,867
[dotsub™]
[Any Video Any Language]

4
00:00:09,867 --> 00:00:12,375
[Michael]
Seventy-five percent of the world

5
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:17,197
doesn't speak any English at all,
and people emotionally connect with,

6
00:00:17,197 --> 00:00:20,912
engage with,
enjoy stories and communication

7
00:00:20,912 --> 00:00:23,041
in their own language.
>> [David] We are

8
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:26,872
an online video captioning
and translation platform.

9
00:00:26,872 --> 00:00:29,194
[Michael]
We received a patent for the process

10
00:00:29,194 --> 00:00:32,259
of a browser-based
or cloud-based tool

11
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:35,626
to enable time coding to be done
by a browser

12
00:00:35,626 --> 00:00:41,400
in a collaborative way, and then subtitling
and captioning be done from a browser.

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,673
We created something
called the VLMS,

14
00:00:43,673 --> 00:00:46,111
the Video Language Management System.

15
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:48,177
[Brooks]
Dotsub's Video Language Management System

16
00:00:48,177 --> 00:00:52,569
is a proprietary system
for tracking and reviewing

17
00:00:52,569 --> 00:00:55,301
and assigning your translation work,
where it empowers

18
00:00:55,301 --> 00:00:58,180
our enterprise users
to have complex workflows

19
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,196
that meet their business needs.
>> [Michael] The first thing that we do

20
00:01:01,196 --> 00:01:05,095
is create a time coded caption
in the source language of the video,

21
00:01:05,095 --> 00:01:09,600
and then enable that
to be edited or reviewed collaboratively

22
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,456
by anyone in the world
with granular permissioning

23
00:01:12,456 --> 00:01:15,010
down to the caption level.

24
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:18,075
[David]
We allow any video to be indexed,

25
00:01:18,075 --> 00:01:22,254
understood, to be accessible,
and to be, really, more engaging

26
00:01:22,254 --> 00:01:24,484
for anybody around the world.

27
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,173
[Dave]
Having a translation—either a caption

28
00:01:26,173 --> 00:01:31,606
or a voiceover—
is a significantly more efficient way

29
00:01:31,606 --> 00:01:33,696
of getting that message across,

30
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:36,296
and a much more emotionally inclusive way—

31
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:39,199
a much better way
of communicating

32
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:41,335
with the people around the world.

33
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:43,494
[Peter]
Most of Dotsub's customers

34
00:01:43,494 --> 00:01:46,137
come to us
with a specific need.

35
00:01:46,137 --> 00:01:50,712
They're trying to use their video assets
in ways to reach new markets,

36
00:01:50,712 --> 00:01:53,010
new audiences,
make it more useful,

37
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:56,029
repurpose it, have it go further,
have it touch more people.

38
00:01:56,029 --> 00:01:58,676
[Dave]
We can provide the, A) the knowledge

39
00:01:58,676 --> 00:02:00,881
and B) the technology
to do it.

40
00:02:00,881 --> 00:02:04,388
The way we work is very much
like like a concierge service.

41
00:02:04,388 --> 00:02:07,569
It never ceases to amaze me
the amount of work

42
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:10,955
what people within Dotsub will go to
to make sure that a customer

43
00:02:10,955 --> 00:02:13,022
gets their work done properly.

44
00:02:13,022 --> 00:02:15,134
[Brooks]
Yeah, and making sure the platform's robust enough.

45
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:18,312
We have two nines uptimes—
it's something we're very proud of,

46
00:02:18,312 --> 00:02:21,161
that we're able to offer such a product
to our end users

47
00:02:21,161 --> 00:02:24,992
at such high availability.
>> [Clara] The idea that you can integrate

48
00:02:24,992 --> 00:02:27,774
your existing account
on an OVP with Dotsub

49
00:02:27,774 --> 00:02:30,607
means that you do not need
to manage files.

50
00:02:30,607 --> 00:02:33,115
The video that is already
on an online video platform,

51
00:02:33,115 --> 00:02:37,039
what you do is you tag it,
we bring it to Dotsub

52
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:40,402
without you having to do
anything else.

53
00:02:40,402 --> 00:02:43,513
Captions are done at Dotsub.
Translations are done at Dotsub.

54
00:02:43,513 --> 00:02:47,251
When they are published,
they are sent back to the OVP.

55
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:50,940
So if the video living in the OVP
is already on a website,

56
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,841
captions will go there live.
>> [Brooks] We can actually seamlessly bring

57
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,024
in your video content,
automatically caption it,

58
00:02:57,024 --> 00:02:59,946
translate it to all your target languages,
upload the result

59
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:02,825
back to your OVP
without a single touch.

60
00:03:02,825 --> 00:03:06,656
I think that's the greatest value added.
>> [Peter] The final review stop

61
00:03:06,656 --> 00:03:09,953
gives people the assurance
that the quality that they want

62
00:03:09,953 --> 00:03:12,832
is under their control
and will be delivered on time.

63
00:03:12,832 --> 00:03:14,832
[Clara]
We want to connect people

64
00:03:14,832 --> 00:03:16,832
from different parts of the world.

65
00:03:16,832 --> 00:03:18,832
We give people the tools
to do what they do best.

66
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:20,998
[Brooks]
Scalability—always looking

67
00:03:20,998 --> 00:03:23,970
to serve not just one user
but a million users.

68
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,515
[Peter] Our biggest customers—
ten out of the Fortune 50 companies

69
00:03:27,515 --> 00:03:32,809
that we work with on a regular basis—
what they're looking for is ease,

70
00:03:32,809 --> 00:03:35,828
speed, and quality
that they can rely on.

71
00:03:35,828 --> 00:03:39,287
[Clara] You can control when things go live
by publishing them.

72
00:03:39,287 --> 00:03:41,795
When they get published here,
they appear there.

73
00:03:41,795 --> 00:03:44,117
It saves a lot of time
and saves a lot of money.

74
00:03:44,117 --> 00:03:46,404
[Brooks] Ensuring we're future proof
to the next level.

75
00:03:46,404 --> 00:03:50,163
Thirty-five, 40% of our users lately
turning towards mobile.

76
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:53,135
[Clara] We have captioners and translators
all over the world.

77
00:03:53,135 --> 00:03:56,659
[Brooks] Taking pride
in the product that we deliver to the end user.

78
00:03:56,659 --> 00:03:58,725
[Dave]
It's a very nice feeling to be a member

79
00:03:58,725 --> 00:04:04,321
of a club that feels so passionately
about the things that you feel passionately about.

80
00:04:04,321 --> 00:04:08,384
You find yourself in a group of people
who are passionate

81
00:04:08,384 --> 00:04:12,239
about doing a good job.
>> [Clara] I have the most amazing team

82
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,239
of project managers.

85
00:04:19,344 --> 00:04:23,268
It's wonderful, really.
>> [Peter] It is fantastic.
