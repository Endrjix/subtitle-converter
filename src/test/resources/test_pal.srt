01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,832
[Brooks]
Dotsub's number one mission is to ensure

2
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:05,960
that video can be communicated
to as many people as possible in the world.

01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:09,867
[dotsub™]
[Any Video Any Language]

4
01:00:09,867 --> 01:00:12,375
[Michael]
Seventy-five percent of the world

5
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:17,197
doesn't speak any English at all,
and people emotionally connect with,

6
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:20,912
engage with,
enjoy stories and communication

7
01:00:20,912 --> 01:00:23,041
in their own language.
>> [David] We are

8
01:00:23,041 --> 01:00:26,872
an online video captioning
and translation platform.

9
01:00:26,872 --> 01:00:29,194
[Michael]
We received a patent for the process

10
01:00:29,194 --> 01:00:32,259
of a browser-based
or cloud-based tool

11
01:00:32,259 --> 01:00:35,626
to enable time coding to be done
by a browser

12
01:00:35,626 --> 01:00:41,400
in a collaborative way, and then subtitling
and captioning be done from a browser.

13
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,673
We created something
called the VLMS,

14
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:46,111
the Video Language Management System.

15
01:00:46,111 --> 01:00:48,177
[Brooks]
Dotsub's Video Language Management System

16
01:00:48,177 --> 01:00:52,569
is a proprietary system
for tracking and reviewing

17
01:00:52,569 --> 01:00:55,301
and assigning your translation work,
where it empowers

18
01:00:55,301 --> 01:00:58,180
our enterprise users
to have complex workflows

19
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:01,196
that meet their business needs.
>> [Michael] The first thing that we do

20
01:01:01,196 --> 01:01:05,095
is create a time coded caption
in the source language of the video,

21
01:01:05,095 --> 01:01:09,600
and then enable that
to be edited or reviewed collaboratively

22
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,456
by anyone in the world
with granular permissioning

23
01:01:12,456 --> 01:01:15,010
down to the caption level.

24
01:01:15,010 --> 01:01:18,075
[David]
We allow any video to be indexed,

25
01:01:18,075 --> 01:01:22,254
understood, to be accessible,
and to be, really, more engaging

26
01:01:22,254 --> 01:01:24,484
for anybody around the world.

27
01:01:24,484 --> 01:01:26,173
[Dave]
Having a translation—either a caption

28
01:01:26,173 --> 01:01:31,606
or a voiceover—
is a significantly more efficient way

29
01:01:31,606 --> 01:01:33,696
of getting that message across,

30
01:01:33,696 --> 01:01:36,296
and a much more emotionally inclusive way—

31
01:01:36,296 --> 01:01:39,199
a much better way
of communicating

32
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:41,335
with the people around the world.

33
01:01:41,335 --> 01:01:43,494
[Peter]
Most of Dotsub's customers

34
01:01:43,494 --> 01:01:46,137
come to us
with a specific need.

35
01:01:46,137 --> 01:01:50,712
They're trying to use their video assets
in ways to reach new markets,

36
01:01:50,712 --> 01:01:53,010
new audiences,
make it more useful,

37
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:56,029
repurpose it, have it go further,
have it touch more people.

38
01:01:56,029 --> 01:01:58,676
[Dave]
We can provide the, A) the knowledge

39
01:01:58,676 --> 01:02:00,881
and B) the technology
to do it.

40
01:02:00,881 --> 01:02:04,388
The way we work is very much
like like a concierge service.

41
01:02:04,388 --> 01:02:07,569
It never ceases to amaze me
the amount of work

42
01:02:07,569 --> 01:02:10,955
what people within Dotsub will go to
to make sure that a customer

43
01:02:10,955 --> 01:02:13,022
gets their work done properly.

44
01:02:13,022 --> 01:02:15,134
[Brooks]
Yeah, and making sure the platform's robust enough.

45
01:02:15,134 --> 01:02:18,312
We have two nines uptimes—
it's something we're very proud of,

46
01:02:18,312 --> 01:02:21,161
that we're able to offer such a product
to our end users

47
01:02:21,161 --> 01:02:24,992
at such high availability.
>> [Clara] The idea that you can integrate

48
01:02:24,992 --> 01:02:27,774
your existing account
on an OVP with Dotsub

49
01:02:27,774 --> 01:02:30,607
means that you do not need
to manage files.

50
01:02:30,607 --> 01:02:33,115
The video that is already
on an online video platform,

51
01:02:33,115 --> 01:02:37,039
what you do is you tag it,
we bring it to Dotsub

52
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:40,402
without you having to do
anything else.

53
01:02:40,402 --> 01:02:43,513
Captions are done at Dotsub.
Translations are done at Dotsub.

54
01:02:43,513 --> 01:02:47,251
When they are published,
they are sent back to the OVP.

55
01:02:47,251 --> 01:02:50,940
So if the video living in the OVP
is already on a website,

56
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:54,841
captions will go there live.
>> [Brooks] We can actually seamlessly bring

57
01:02:54,841 --> 01:02:57,024
in your video content,
automatically caption it,

58
01:02:57,024 --> 01:02:59,946
translate it to all your target languages,
upload the result

59
01:02:59,946 --> 01:03:02,825
back to your OVP
without a single touch.

60
01:03:02,825 --> 01:03:06,656
I think that's the greatest value added.
>> [Peter] The final review stop

61
01:03:06,656 --> 01:03:09,953
gives people the assurance
that the quality that they want

62
01:03:09,953 --> 01:03:12,832
is under their control
and will be delivered on time.

63
01:03:12,832 --> 01:03:14,832
[Clara]
We want to connect people

64
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:16,832
from different parts of the world.

65
01:03:16,832 --> 01:03:18,832
We give people the tools
to do what they do best.

66
01:03:18,832 --> 01:03:20,998
[Brooks]
Scalability—always looking

67
01:03:20,998 --> 01:03:23,970
to serve not just one user
but a million users.

68
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:27,515
[Peter] Our biggest customers—
ten out of the Fortune 50 companies

69
01:03:27,515 --> 01:03:32,809
that we work with on a regular basis—
what they're looking for is ease,

70
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:35,828
speed, and quality
that they can rely on.

71
01:03:35,828 --> 01:03:39,287
[Clara] You can control when things go live
by publishing them.

72
01:03:39,287 --> 01:03:41,795
When they get published here,
they appear there.

73
01:03:41,795 --> 01:03:44,117
It saves a lot of time
and saves a lot of money.

74
01:03:44,117 --> 01:03:46,404
[Brooks] Ensuring we're future proof
to the next level.

75
01:03:46,404 --> 01:03:50,163
Thirty-five, 40% of our users lately
turning towards mobile.

76
01:03:50,163 --> 01:03:53,135
[Clara] We have captioners and translators
all over the world.

77
01:03:53,135 --> 01:03:56,659
[Brooks] Taking pride
in the product that we deliver to the end user.

78
01:03:56,659 --> 01:03:58,725
[Dave]
It's a very nice feeling to be a member

79
01:03:58,725 --> 01:04:04,321
of a club that feels so passionately
about the things that you feel passionately about.

80
01:04:04,321 --> 01:04:08,384
You find yourself in a group of people
who are passionate

81
01:04:08,384 --> 01:04:12,239
about doing a good job.
>> [Clara] I have the most amazing team

82
01:04:12,239 --> 01:04:14,239
of project managers.

85
01:04:19,344 --> 01:04:23,268
It's wonderful, really.
>> [Peter] It is fantastic.
